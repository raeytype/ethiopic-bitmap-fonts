These are the Ethiopic source files that generated the .psf in the
directory above.  Initial work was done for the size 16 fonts using
the "xfed" editor under X Windows.  

Sizes 14 and 12 are essentially just size 16 with extra scan lines
chopped off and minimal extra work done to repair damaged characters.
Except in GohaClassic (an unmodified port of the Goha WP font) the fonts
are all using the same punctuation and number characters which are also
provided in their own source files.  Keep in mind also that console 
fonts have an 8 dot width limit.

The Goha, GohaA, and GohaB font differ only by the design of the "le"
series.  Feedback would be appreciated to resolve which vesion is
preffered.

I have not tried installing the bdf files under X Windows but they should
work.  The 16 point fonts could be applied in Mule.  Should anyone actually
make the effort to enhance the fonts, please let me know!!!!
