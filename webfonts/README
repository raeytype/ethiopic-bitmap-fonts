These fonts are the first in a series for Ethiopic Web 
under Netscape 2.0+.  Short file names are used so that
they may be stored in compressed format and read from
Xservers (this maybe only a Linux compress limitation).


To Install Fonts:
=================

A ``Makefile'' is now provided.  If you have GNU Make and a nice X11 system
all should go as  smoothly as the two commands:

 1)  make 
 2)  make install 


That's It!!!


If you did get an error of some sort do the following by hand:

 bdftopcf fidel11.bdf > fidel11.pcf
 bdftopcf fidel12.bdf > fidel12.pcf
 bdftopcf fidel15.bdf > fidel15.pcf
 bdftopcf fidel18.bdf > fidel18.pcf
 bdftopcf fidel20.bdf > fidel20.pcf

 compress *.pcf
 gzip *.bdf          -this step is NOT optional
 xset fp+ `pwd`


This should work unless:

 1) At your site you do not have permission to add fonts to the X server.
 2) You are on an older Sun OpenWindows systems and can't use .pcf files.
    Try ``man fontconvert'' to convert and install bdf fonts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Recommended Netscapes default sizes are:

Select Size 12 from Proportional Font menu and Size 11 from Fixed Font
 menu, defaults then set to:

  <h1> = fidel 20
  <h2> = fidel 18
  <h3> = fidel 15
  <h4> = fidel 12
  <font size=-1> = fidel 11
  <pre> = fidel 11


Examine and experiment with sizes using the provided fontsizes.html file.


Font Notes:


  fidel12.bdf  is the complete Unicode font with extensions.
  fidel18.bdf and fidel11.bdf  do not complete the Unicode domain nor offer
              extensions.
  fidel15.bdf and fidel20.bdf  complete the Unicode domain but do not offer
              extensions.
  fidel20.bdf is really size 30
  


To Set Up Netscape 2.0+ For Fidel on X11
========================================


  1. Add to your .Xresources or .Xdefaults the line: 

       netscape*menuBar*jaAuto.labelString: Ethiopic (Uni-JIS) 

     ...or some description that makes you happy :-) 

  2. Restart your X server (I forget how to do this) or exit X and restart
     (could mean logout and log back in). 

  3. Start Netscape 

  4. Under the ``Options'' menu select ``Language Encoding'' and then
     choose the 3rd item which should say ``Ethiopian (Uni-JIS)''. 
     [It will still say ``Japanese (Auto-Select)'' if you did not restart X.] 

  5. Select ``Options'' one more time and choose ``General Preferences...'' 
     When you have the folders menu select ``Fonts''. 

  6. From ``Use the Proportional Font'' select ``Fidel (Admas)'' and Size: ``12''. 
       For ``Use the Fixed Font'' select ``Fidel (Admas)'' and Size: ``11''. 

  7. Select ``Options'' one more time and now choose ``Save_Options''. 

  8. Open the provided file ``fidel.html''. You should find 411 characters
     in an extended Unicode matrix. Also see ``fontsizes.html''. 

  9. Write me please to report any successes or failures.
